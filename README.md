## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew, and I'm a self-trained computer scientist interested in all things Node.js & Data Science! As a young kid I learned about computers by tinkering with MSDOS and infamous flood-ping attacks (White-hat hacking *cough cough). My uncle worked for Microsoft in the early stages as a Senior Dev and was generous in teaching me C# + letting me rummage through his book collection.
