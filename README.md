## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew, and I'm a self-trained computer scientist interested in all things Node.js & Data Science! As a young kid I learned about computers by tinkering with MSDOS and infamous flood-pinging attacks (white-hat of course). My uncle had worked for Microsoft as a Senior Dev and was generous enough to teach me concepts of C#. Over time my thirst for knowledge grew and thus the journey began.
