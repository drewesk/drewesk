## Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Drew, and I'm an self-trained computer scientist interested in all things Node.js & Data Science! As a kid I learned about computers tinkering with MSDOS using ethical "white-hat hacking" and executing flood-ping attacks. Overtime my passion grew about the innerworkings of network-based technologies and so the journey began.
