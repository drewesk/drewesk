## ðŸ‘‹ Shalom! I'm Drew ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=drewesk&color=blue&style=flat)

I'm a self-taught coder and ethical hacker passionate about **Node.js**, **data science**, and building systems that scale.

My journey began in childhood, tinkering with MS-DOS and experimenting with (white-hat!) ping flood attacks. I was lucky to have an uncle who worked as a Senior Developer at Microsoft â€” he introduced me to C# and fundamental programming concepts, and that set the course for a lifelong love of software engineering.

ðŸ“ˆ I focus on writing clean, maintainable code using:
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Modular and reusable architectures**
- **Industry-standard conventions**
